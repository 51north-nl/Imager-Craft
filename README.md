Imager for Craft 3.x
===

Updated version of the docs for 2.0 are in the works!  
For now, have a look at the [docs for 1.0](https://github.com/aelvan/Imager-Craft/blob/master/README.md), 
most of the basic template functionality is exactly the same. 
Quite a few configuration settings have been changed, please refer 
to the [Settings.php file](https://github.com/aelvan/Imager-Craft/blob/craft3/src/models/Settings.php)
for pointers.
